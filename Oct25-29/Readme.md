## Java: 

Find the Contiguous Subarray with Sum to a Given Value in an array. 

For example : 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 

arr[]={14, 12, 70, 15, 99, 65, 21, 90}; 
X =97. 
Sum found between index 1 to 3 
Elements are 12, 70 and 15

## Python: 

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence. 

Example: 
0100,0011,1010,1001 
Then the output should be: 
1010 

Notes: Assume the data is input by console. 

C#/.NET 

Create a function that returns the simplified version of a fraction. 

Examples: 
Simplify("4/6") --> "2/3" 

Simplify("10/11") --> "10/11" 

Simplify("100/400") --> "1/4" 

Simplify("8/4") --> "2"

## JavaScript: 

1) This is based on Helen Yu's Making a Box challenge. This challenge is the same execpt that instead of an array of strings, your function should output a matrix of characters. 

Examples 
charBox(1) --> [ 
["#"] 
] 

charBox(4) --> [ 
["#", "#", "#", "#"], 
["#", " ", " ", "#"], 
["#", " ", " ", "#"], 
["#", "#", "#", "#"] 
] 

charBox(2) --> [ 
["#", "#"], 
["#", "#"] 
] 
Notes 
As an added bonus, try making charBox(0) output [[]] and make any strings, non-integers, and negative numbers output -1. 

Note: 
A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (except 1) between the numerator and the denominator. For example, 4/6 is not simplified, since 4 and 6 both share 2 as a factor. 

2) Write a function that retrieves the top 3 longest words of a newspaper headline and transforms them into hashtags. If multiple words tie for the same length, retrieve the word that occurs first. 

Examples 
getHashTags("How the Avocado Became the Fruit of the Global Trade") 
--> ["#avocado", "#became", "#global"] 

getHashTags("Why You Will Probably Pay More for Your Christmas Tree This Year") 
--> ["#christmas", "#probably", "#will"] 

getHashTags("Hey Parents, Surprise, Fruit Juice Is Not Fruit") 
--> ["#surprise", "#parents", "#fruit"] 

getHashTags("Visualizing Science") 
--> ["#visualizing", "#science"] 

Notes: 
If the title is less than 3 words, just order the words in the title by length in descending order (see example #4). 

Punctuation does not count towards a word's length.

## DeVops: 

1) How would you deploy software to 5000 nodes? 

2) How would you introduce Continuous Delivery in a successful, huge company for which the change from Waterfall to Continuous Delivery would be not trivial, because of the size and complexity of the business?
