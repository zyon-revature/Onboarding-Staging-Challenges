# Onboarding-Staging-Challenges

## October

### Week Oct. 11 - 16
Java
1. Write a Java Program to iterate HashMap using While and advance for loop. 
2. Write a program which accepts two given String and checks if they are the rotation of each. If they then return true otherwise return false. A String is said to be a rotation of other string if they contain same characters and the sequence is rotated across any character, e.g. "dabc" is a rotation of "abcd" but "dbac" is not.
